Behavioral based Insider Threat Detection

The most harmful cyber attacks are usually not originated by malicious outsiders or malware but from trusted insiders. The main advantage insider attackers have over external elements is their ability to bypass security checks and remain undiscovered. This may cause serious damage to the organizational assets. This project focuses on insider threat detection through behavioral analysis of users. User behavior is categorized as normal or malicious based on user activity. A series of events and activities are analyzed for feature selection to efficiently detect adversarial behavior. Also a message is sent as an alert to the authorities regarding the daily count and user idâ€™s of malicious users.
